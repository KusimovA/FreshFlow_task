This is just a brief overview of what I would start with. There is obviously so much to do in addition.

## Approach

I tried different models with different features. Please, see notebook in the repo.

## Metric
I think that it's reasonable to choose SMAPE for our case.

SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) is a commonly used metric for evaluating the accuracy of sales forecasting models. It is symmetric, meaning that it treats over-predictions and under-predictions equally, and it is based on percentage error, which allows for easy interpretation of the magnitude of the error. Additionally, SMAPE is scale-independent, meaning that it can be applied to sales forecasts for different products or different time periods, regardless of the scale of the sales. For these reasons, SMAPE is a good choice for evaluating the accuracy of sales forecasting models.
